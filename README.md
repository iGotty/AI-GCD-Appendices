# AI-GCD-Appendices

## Overview  
This repository contains supplementary materials for the article  
**"AI-Generated Code Detection: An Examination of Current Tools in Education."**  
It provides the full set of AI-generated prompts, human-written and AI-generated code examples, and different code transformations used in the study.

## Repository Contents  

### ðŸ“„ Appendix A: Full Prompts for AI Solution Generation  
This section contains all the prompts used to generate AI-written code variations. The prompts introduce different transformations, including:  
- **No Variants** (Standard AI-generated code)  
- **Variable Name Substitution** (Randomized variable names)  
- **Verbose Code** (Unnecessarily long solutions)  
- **Concise Code** (Minimized solution length)  
- **Dead Code Insertion** (Useless, non-functional code snippets)  
- **No Comments** (Solutions without comments)  

### ðŸ“„ Appendix B: Examples of Code Variants  
This section provides code samples categorized as:  
- **Human-Written Code** â€“ Examples of code written by humans.  
- **AI-Generated Code Variants** â€“ AI-generated solutions following different transformations.
